"# AUTOMATED-HEART-DISEASE-DIAGNOSIS-SYSTEM-USING-GENETIC-FEATURE-SELECTION" 

Presents a new hybrid model for an Automated Heart Disease Diagnosis (AHDD) system that integrates a binary Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Genetic-Algorithm based Feature Selection wrapper.

Identifies the best set of classification features for Heart Disease diagnosis by adjusting the feature weights using GA

Implemented using Python and benchmarked against various ML and DL classification models.
